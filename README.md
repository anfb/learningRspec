# learningRspec
I created this repository to learn about unit test using rspec

## Get Started!
### Instalations
* We need to install [ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) on windows (Sorry I use windows rsrs)
please, download the recommendation version with devkit.

> **Observação:** Attention! close any prompt before instalation

after install ruby execute the following command:
```
ridk install 
```
* We need to install Console Emulator([Cmder](https://cmder.net/)) 
* We need use any text editor, I'll use the Visual Studio Code [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### first step 
Open the Cmder and type the command to create a new folder:
```
mkdir learningRspec
```
then inside the new folder, type the command:
```
bundle init
``` 
The command "bundle init" will initialize a ruby project and create a file called Gemfile

Inside Gemfile write the text bellow: 
```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem 'rspec'
```
